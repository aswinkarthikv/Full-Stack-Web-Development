Hi, Iâ€™m Aswin Karthik Vijayakumar, a third-year B.Tech Computer Science and Engineering student from SRM Institute of Science and Technology, Trichy. This repository showcases my hands-on journey in Full Stack Web Development using Spring Boot for the backend and modern frontend technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and optionally React. Each project in this collection reflects my ability to build complete, scalable web applications â€” from creating secure and efficient RESTful APIs using Spring Boot and managing databases with MySQL and JPA, to developing responsive user interfaces with proper form validation and clean UI/UX practices. 

This collection showcases my ability to:

Design scalable backend systems with Spring Boot (including MVC architecture, services, and repositories)

Build and consume REST APIs securely and efficiently

Implement full CRUD functionality with frontend-backend integration

Design relational databases and manage schema with real-time connectivity

Develop intuitive UIs using HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, and JS

Handle form validations, sessions, authentication (JWT/Basic Auth)

Deploy projects using GitHub, and platforms like Render or Railway

Whether youâ€™re a fellow developer, recruiter, or someone looking to learn full stack with Java backend â€” youâ€™ll find valuable references here. Iâ€™ll continue updating this repository with new features, advanced concepts (like Spring Security, Swagger, Docker), and real-time mini projects.

ðŸ“Œ Stack Used:
Frontend â€“ HTML/CSS/JS, Bootstrap
Backend â€“ Spring Boot, Java, REST APIs
